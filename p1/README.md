## Notes for instructor

* In first javascript word game, I used *isAlpha(ch)* function to check for keypress. I was trying to replicate the same functionality in this Vue.js project but I am not sure how to do it yet. In this project, I looped through the *possibleLetters* Array to display all letters A-Z in the alphabet and allow the user to make his or her guess. That is the only added feature.
