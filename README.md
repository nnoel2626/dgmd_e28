<https://hesweb.dev/e28>

My name is *Norcius Noel* and I am a returning student from **DWA-E15**. I was quite pleased with the way you structured and organized your course the last time then I decided to take ["Vue.js"](https://vuejs.org) with you.

Last year Angular with Larry Bouteliere and I am looking to broaden my knowledge with a different Javascript framework.
So far I have taken:

* CSCI E-31	
* DGMD S-23	
* DGMD E-27	
* DGMD E-20 
* DGMD E-25	
* CSCI E-3	
* CSCI E-60
