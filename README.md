### Course Website for DGMD E28 is <https://hesweb.dev/e28>

My name is *Norcius Noel* and I am a returning student from **DWA-E15**. I was quite pleased with the way you structured and organized your course the last time so I decided to enroll this ["Vue.js"](https://vuejs.org) class.

Last semester I took CSCI E-31 (Web App Development/Node.JS) with Larry Bouthillier and now I am looking forward to broaden my knowledge with a different Javascript framework.

**So far I have taken the following classes:**

* CSCI E-31	
* DGMD S-23	
* DGMD E-27	
* DGMD E-20 
* DGMD E-25	
* CSCI E-3	
* CSCI E-60	
* CSCI E-15
* CSCI S-12
