## Course for DGMD E28
<https://hesweb.dev/e28>

My name is *Norcius Noel* and I am a returning student from **DWA-E15**. I was quite pleased with the way you structured and organized your course the last time then I decided to take ["Vue.js"](https://vuejs.org) with you.

Last year Angular with Larry Bouteliere and I am looking to broaden my knowledge with a different Javascript framework.
So far I have taken:
```
- **CSCI E-31**	
- **DGMD S-23**	
- **DGMD E-27**	
- **DGMD E-20** 
- **DGMD E-25**	
- **CSCI E-3**	
- **CSCI E-60**	
- **CSCI E-15** 
```
My Github username is `<nnoel2626>` and my email address is `<nnoel@fas.harvard.edu.>`
