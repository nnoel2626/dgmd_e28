Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include context and code examples in your answers when relevant.

Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?

**Answer: No, the application worked fine except the "return to all jokes button does not work.**

Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?

**Answer: Looking thought the code, it seems like there are a few of components that are not being  used yet such as the GraphPage.vue, SettingsPage.vue and so forth. Having them in the code is confusing.**

Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?

**Answer: Besides the un-used vue components, everything else was self-evident.**

Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?

**Answer: No, I did find any thing new in the code.**

Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?

**Answer: All the content is floated the left side of the page. It is best practice to center content to the page specially for mobile first design. I would also add some background color to have some contrast.**

Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
**Answer: No**
