<https://hesweb.dev/e28>

My name is *Norcius Noel* and I am a returning student from **DWA-E15**. I was quite pleased with the way you structured and organized your course the last time then I decided to take _ ["Vue.js"](https://vuejs.org) with you.

Last year Angular with Larry Bouteliere and I am looking to broaden my knowledge with a different Javascript framework.
So far I have taken:
	* CSCI E-31	1
	* DGMD S-23	2
	* DGMD E-27	3
	* DGMD E-20 4
	* DGMD E-25	5
	* CSCI E-3	6
	* CSCI E-60	7
	* CSCI E-15 8

My Github username is `<nnoel2626>` and my email address is `<nnoel@fas.harvard.edu.>`
